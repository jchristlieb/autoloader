# PSR-4 implementation

This is a tiny project implemented with OOP in PSR-4 autoload standard.

There are two classes in different directories:
* `Àuthor` in /src/
* `Book` in /src/resources

Autoload configuration:
* project root directory as `Project` is /src. 
* `autoloader` is required at `index.php`.

A program execution is written in `èxample.php`. Run the program with `php example.php` 
and Ben Hardy will write his book `Willpower doesn't work`.
